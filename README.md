# kernel-uptodate
Script for checking if latest installed kernel is running

Install script in /usr/local/bin

Add entries to root crontab


## todo:

Better place for logs (and rotate them)

Put this all in an RPM

Compare to how cloud OS does this check at login

Generalise for different distributions

One-line command? For easy cut-and-paste
